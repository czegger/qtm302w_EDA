## Project Intro/Objective
Healthcare accessibility is a source of significant inequality in the United States. Without no universal coverage policy, healthcarecare accessibility is largely connected to health insurance ownership. This project aims to illustrate associations between private health insurance ownership and demographic variables commonly used in the health sciences (race, education level, English proficiency). By drawing attention to these correlations, we hope to reveal how insurance may have downstream effects on healthcare outcomes, and encourage future investigators and policymakers to see this as a potential target.

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
